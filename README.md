# Windows Development Box

Sadly, I do still have to do some Windows based development. This repository is intended to provide a Packer template I can use to generate a Windows dev box.

What I intend to have in the box:

* Visual Studio Community Edition
* Cygwin
* .NET 3.5
* .NET 4.5
* Vim (independent of the Cygwin install)
* IIS
